Study of AI models for Medical Image Generation and Classification


This is a collection of the work done in my undergraduate summer research with a group of graduate students and Professor Yu Gan. 
Included are my model training and data cleaning scripts.

The initial phase of the research was improving the accuracy of existing models using an architecture landscape image dataset. 
The research continued to be more of the same, using kibble, tumor, and retinal CT scans for further testing.
